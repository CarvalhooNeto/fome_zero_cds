# The busniness problem

Fome Zero is a company that has an application that connects restaurants and customers. This application works very similarly to the iFood, Uber eats, Doordash, GrubHub applications commonly known in the West.

The company's core is focused on disseminating the culinary types spread around the world in order to connect more people with different types of cuisines.

Currently, the CEO of Fome Zero is aware that the company's revenue is growing. However, he would like to go deeper into its growth in order to understand what grows when the company grows and how it grows. Thus, he could develop greater accuracy under which levers to trigger to stimulate or not the company's growth according to future strategies.

Under this demand, the initial need was defined to create an overview of the growth and the current state of each of the pillars of the Zero Hunger business, thus exploring countries, cities and culinary types.
